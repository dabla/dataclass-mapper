Development
-----------

This project is derived from a python-simple-project template `https://git.infrabel.be/business-intelligence/playground/mathieu-monet-exo999/python-simple-project` which in
turn derived from
a `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/index.html>`_ 
**data science template** inspired by 
`The Data Science Workflow <https://towardsdatascience.com/the-data-science-workflow-43859db0415>`_ 
and `Cookiecutter Data Science <https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/>`_.
This section explains how to take advantage of the structure, functionality and tools within this template 
to develop qualitative, tested and documented code.
